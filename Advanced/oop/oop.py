print("***OBJECT ORIENTED***")
print("""Python has been an object-oriented language since the time it existed. Due to this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy. This chapter helps you become an expert in using Python's object-oriented programming support. 
If you do not have any previous experience with object-oriented (OO) programming, you may want to consult an introductory course on it or at least a tutorial of some sort so that you have a grasp of the basic concepts. 
However, here is a small introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to help you. """)

print("\n*Overview of OOP Terminology*")
print("*Class: A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation. ")
print("*Class variable: A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are. ")
print("*Data member: A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects. ")
print("*Function overloading: The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.")
print("*Instance variable: A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.")
print("*Inheritance: The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it. ")
print("*Instance: An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.")
print("*Instantiation: The creation of an instance of a class. ")
print("*Method: A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.")
print("*Object: A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods. ")
print("*Operator overloading: The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.")

print("\n*Creating Classes*")
print("""The class statement creates a new class definition. The name of the class immediately follows the keyword class followed by a colon as follows- 
class ClassName: 
   'Optional class documentation string' 
   class_suite 
    * The class has a documentation string, which can be accessed viaClassName.__doc__.  
    * The class_suite consists of all the component statements defining class members, data attributes and functions. """)

    *  You declare other class methods like normal functions with the exception that the first argument to each method is self. Python adds the self argument to the list for you; you do not need to include it when you call the methods.""")

print("\n*Destroying Objects (Garbage Collection)*")
print("""Python deletes unneeded objects (built-in types or class instances) automatically to free the memory space. The process by which Python periodically reclaims blocks of memory that no longer are in use is termed as Garbage Collection. 
Python's garbage collector runs during program execution and is triggered when an object's reference count reaches zero. An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases that point to it changes. 
An object's reference count increases when it is assigned a new name or placed in a container (list, tuple, or dictionary). The object's reference count decreases when it is deleted with del, its reference is reassigned, or its reference goes out of scope. When an object's reference count reaches zero, Python collects it automatically. 
a = 40      # Create object <40> 
b = a       # Increase ref. count  of <40>  
c = [b]     # Increase ref. count  of <40>   
del a       # Decrease ref. count  of <40> 
b = 100     # Decrease ref. count  of <40>  
c[0] = -1   # Decrease ref. count  of <40>  
You normally will not notice when the garbage collector destroys an orphaned instance and reclaims its space. However, a class can implement the special method__del__(), called a destructor, that is invoked when the instance is about to be destroyed. This method might be used to clean up any non-memory resources used by an instance. """)
